# Node / Express Exercise Tester

This is intended to test a finished application that follows the expectations laid out in the [node-express](../node-express) directory.

The tester expects you Express application to be running on `localhost` and port `3000`. If it is not on port `3000` edit the value at the top of `index.spec.ts`.

Be sure dependencies are installed, and then run `npm test`.
