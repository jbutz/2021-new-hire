# TypeScript Exercise

Take the script file from the JavaScript exercise and copy it into the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).
Make improvements by adding types and using additional features available for classes. Can you improve upon your solution?

To test out your changes you can:

1. Copy the output from the JS side of the Playground back into the script file and run it using the HTML file
2. Add `run().then(console.log);` to the end of your code in the TypeScript Playground and click `Run`. The Playground's `Logs` tab will have your output.
